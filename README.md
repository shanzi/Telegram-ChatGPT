[Deploy this function on flows.network](https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/Telegram-ChatGPT), and you will get a Telegram bot that uses ChatGPT to respond to every question in your Telegram DM or channel/group automatically.

Try a couple of Telegram bots on flows.network yourself!

* This is a [simple ChatGPT bot](https://t.me/flows_network_gpt_bot) that is created directly from the template. 
* The [multimodal assistant bot](https://t.me/flows_english_assistant_bot) is based on this template. It can recognize text on uploaded pictures using flows.network's built in OCR service. It also has several task prompts already set up as slash commands. 


## Prerequisites

* You will need to bring your own [OpenAI API key](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api). If you do not already have one, [sign up here](https://platform.openai.com/signup).

* You also need a bot token to access the Telegram API. If you don't already have one, go to Telegram to get a bot token from [@botfather](https://telegram.me/BotFather).


## Deploy your Telegram ChatGPT bot in 3 steps

1. Create a bot from a template
2. Add your ChatGPT API key
3. Add the telegram bot token

Click on **Deploy** button.

## Give it a try. 

As soon as the flow function's status becomes `ready` and the flow's status becomes `running`, the Telegram Telegram bot goes live. Go ahead and send a private message to the bot! You can also invite this bot to your channel/group.
